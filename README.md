# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project is mobile app built in React Native. 

## The problem

The mobile app I built is a dog randomizer where you get at random dog fetched from an API everytime you refresh the page, or press the button. I have used styled components and fetched the images of the dogs from an API. I wanted it to be possible to share an specific image with a friend, but it turned out it only worked for text message So when you click the "Share button", you just share a text with the dog API.
